We break down the new active aerodynamics system (Z-mode vs X-mode), how it replaces classic DRS, and why one software glitch could turn a corner into a lawsuit.\n\nThen we get into the heart of it: the radical 50/50 hybrid power split, the death of the MGU-H, the rise of a mega MGU-K, and the real risk of battery-saving trains down the straight if the numbers don’t add up. Is this cutting-edge engineering… or over-complicated energy cosplay?\n\nAudi. Ford. Cadillac. Six power unit suppliers. A reshuffled grid. A political minefield. We look at why manufacturers are suddenly all-in — and why that might lock F1 into this rule set whether it works or not.\n\nMost YouTube explainers just repeat FIA talking points. This one calls them out.\n\nWill 2026 save racing or break it? Will active aero actually help overtaking, or just hand more power to the biggest nerds in the room? Are we heading toward a golden era… or another beautifully over-engineered mess?\n\nWatch, decide, and join the war in the comments. Because this isn’t just about new cars — it’s about what kind of sport F1 wants to be.\n\nIf you’re tired of sugar-coated “explainer” content, you’re in the right place. 👊\n\n00:00 – F1 2026: Revolution or Beautiful Disaster?\n01:07 – How We Got Here (And Why F1 Keeps ‘Fixing’ Itself)\n00:55 – Smaller Cars, Shorter Wheelbase: Does Size Finally Matter?\n01:56 – The Weight Diet: From Trucks Back to Race Cars\n03:14 – Tire Nerf: Narrow Rubber, Bigger Skill Ceiling\n04:31 – Active Aero 101: X-Mode, Z-Mode & Moving Wing Chaos\n05:55 – New Power Units: 50/50 Hybrid & The Energy Problem\n07:23 – Audi, Ford, Cadillac: Why 2026 Pulled the Giants Back\n09:28 – Will Anyone Actually Overtake?

    "transcript": "F1 2026: Revolution or Beautiful Disaster? So, here we are again, folks. Formula 1 has decided it's time for another revolutionary overhaul. The 2026 regulations promise smaller, lighter, more agile cars that will supposedly transform racing as we know it. For veterans who remember when engines could wake the dead from three time zones away, you know the drill. F1 creates a problem, ignores it for a decade, then presents a fix as a groundbreaking innovation. It's the cycle of life in this sport. For newcomers who just found F1 through Netflix, welcome to the beautiful unhinged madness. Whether you started watching during the shoe marker dominance or just discovered F1 through Netflix, these regulations will fundamentally change what you're watching come 2026. Let's dive into what's really changing and whether F1 is finally learning from its mistakes or just creating new ones with extra steps. Here's something that shouldn't be revolutionary, but apparently is. F1 has figured out that massive cars might not be ideal for close racing. Shocking revelation truly. The 2026 cars shrink significantly. Wheelbase drops 200 mm to 3,400 mm. Width cuts 100 mm to 1,900 mm How We Got Here (And Why F1 Keeps ‘Fixing’ Itself) and floor width loses 150 mm. We're going from luxury yachts to large sedans. Still not nimble, but progress nonetheless. For veterans who remember when F1 cars looked like proper racing machines, these dimensions are still massive. The legendary MP4/4 had a wheelbase of just 2,875 mm, a little over 500 mm shorter than 2,26 cars. But at least we're moving towards sanity. The dimensional changes directly contribute to that massive 55% drag reduction from the active aeros. Smaller cars create less aerodynamic disruption, theoretically allowing following cars to stay closer. Current F1 cars are like driving behind moving walls. The 2026 machines should create cleaner wakes, making the grid feel slightly less congested. The minimum The Weight Diet: From Trucks Back to Race Cars weight drops to 768 kg, a 30 kg reduction. This marks the first significant mandated weight cut in over two decades, deliberately reversing the trend of ever heavier machines. This is more than trimming fat. its F1 admitting its cars became bloated beyond recognition. To understand why this matters, the legendary MP4/4 weighed around 540 kg. Current cars tip the scales at 800 kg, nearly 50% heavier than the machine that won 15 out of 16 races. We've added 260 kg over three decades while making cars longer, wider, and more complex. While this 30 kg cut moves us only from morbidly obese to merely overweight, it is genuine progress. It's high time if one's thoroughbred started looking like a racehorse again, not a Clydesdale. Every kilogram matters exponentially in racing. Lighter cars require less energy to accelerate, making that 8.5 mega of energy recovery per lap more efficient. The electrical systems become more effective when not fighting unnecessary mass. For drivers who've never experienced truly lightweight F1 cars, they're about to discover what they've been missing. The combination of less weight, shorter wheelbase, and narrower dimensions should create genuinely agile machines for the first time in decades, allowing them to truly feel the steering inputs again. While everyone obsesses over active arrow, Pirelli is quietly Tire Nerf: Narrow Rubber, Bigger Skill Ceiling being asked to perform miracles with rubber and physics. Front tires lose 25 mm, rears lose 30 mm. That's a significant reduction in contact patches. For anyone who understands grip, those are substantial changes. The 18-in rims stay because apparently F1 learned not to change everything at once. Here's the real story. Narrower tires are crucial for achieving that 55% drag reduction. Wider tires are rotating walls that churn up air and make following cars miserable. By shrinking contact patches, F1 is trying to clean up the aerodynamic wake that's plagued close racing for decades. The question is whether Pirelli can maintain grip with less rubber while teams deal with 30% less downforce. That's asking a lot from tire chemistry. For veterans, narrower tires represent a return to sanity. There's something to be said for tires requiring skill rather than providing endless grip. Remember when drivers had to modulate throttle to avoid spinning? The narrower contact patches should bring back driver skill elements engineered out of modern F1. The irony? F1 spent years making tires wider to improve spectacle. Now they're making them narrower for the same reason. It's a perfect example of F1 chasing its own tail. We'll see if the skill versus grip balance finally lands in the right place. Active aerodynamics, Active Aero 101: X-Mode, Z-Mode & Moving Wing Chaos the feature that has purists reaching for blood pressure medication. But the numbers behind this system are either brilliant or insane, possibly both. The performance delta is staggering, enabling drivers to switch between a high downforce cornering setup and a speed maximizing low drag configuration on command midlap. Z mode is the default high down force setting, engaging the full capacity of the front and rear wings for maximum cornering grip. X mode instantly flattens the wings for straight line speed, creating essentially different race cars. The front wing gets a 100 mm reduction with a sophisticated flap design to reduce disruption for following cars. The rear wing's three element system allows complex airflow control in both modes. For those who remember when aerodynamics meant make it slippery and add wings, this feels like over complication. Fixed wings forced hard choices. Active arrow lets teams have maximum downforce in corners and minimum drag on straights. Technically impressive, philosophically questionable. The reliability concern is real. More moving parts mean more failures. A DRS failure cost straight line speed. Active aero failure in wrong mode could cost entire aerodynamic balance. Imagine being stuck in X mode through Monaco or Z mode on Monza Straits. The radical level of drag reduction could genuinely transform racing or just make everything more complicated. The heart of the 2026 revolution is the New Power Units: 50/50 Hybrid & The Energy Problem new power unit, which shifts the emphasis to electricity. The regulations mandate a near 50/50 power split between the traditional internal combustion engine ICE and the beefed up electric motor generator unit Kinetic MGUK. The old MGUH, the complex system that recovered energy from exhaust heat, is gone, supposedly simplifying things. Instead, all electrical energy is recovered through braking, MGUK, or generated directly by the engine. The override system replaces DRS entirely. When within 1 second of the car ahead, a driver can deploy an electric boost, delivering full power up to a higher speed than the car in front, allowing for a decisive overtaking opportunity. The controversy, the complexity didn't disappear. It just moved to energy management. A strict 8.5 megajoule harvesting limit per lap is in place and engineers are already sounding alarms. The core problem is simple physics. Most circuits like Spar or Silverstone simply don't have enough heavy braking zones to consistently recover the required energy for a full lap. This has led to immediate talk about reducing the MGUK's maximum power output mid race. a tacid admission that the 50-50 split might be fundamentally flawed and could force drivers into embarrassing economy runs on straits. Finally, the 100% sustainable fuel mandate aligns F1 with automotive trends and environmental goals. Whether racing should lead environmental initiatives or provide escape from them depends on your perspective and tolerance for motorsport virtue signaling. Here's where 2026 gets Audi, Ford, Cadillac: Why 2026 Pulled the Giants Back genuinely exciting. Major manufacturers are returning with serious money and ambition, validating F1's hybrid future. Audi isn't just participating, they're cannonballing into the deep end, taking over Saaba and developing their own power unit represents massive commitment. They are betting motorsport credibility on F1's hybrid vision. That 350 kW MGUK, an 8.5 mega energy recovery, directly translates to their EV development needs. Ford's partnership with Red Bull marks their return after decades away. Rather than starting from scratch, they're leveraging Red Bull's success while showcasing hybrid engineering capabilities. The Ford name carries serious motorsport heritage, adding manufacturer rivalry F1's been missing. Cadillac enters as the 11th team, initially using Ferrari power while developing their own engine for as early as 2028. This represents GM's renewed global motorsport commitment and F1's American expansion. The two-phase approach is strategically brilliant. immediate participation without massive upfront power unit investment. These entries create six power unit manufacturers, the most diverse engine competition in decades. Different approaches to the 50/50 split should drive innovation and create genuine performance differences. More suppliers means better deals and more competitive packages across the grid. For American fans, Ford and Cadillac provide genuine domestic connections beyond just drivers or races. It's American manufacturers with American engineering competing at the highest level. The manufacturer involvement provides regulatory stability. When automotive companies invest billions in specific technical regulations, those rules become harder to change arbitrarily. Of course, manufacturer F1 history is mixed. Honda has left four times. BMW departed after winning championships. Toyota spent billions winning nothing. The difference this time might be direct road car relevance. The 2026 hybrid focus changes the justification equation significantly. The uncomfortable truth, regulations rarely deliver exactly what they promise. F1 teams employ the smartest engineers on the planet whose job is finding advantages within whatever rules exist. The 2022 ground Will Anyone Actually Overtake? Real Racing vs Simulation Racing effect regulations were supposed to improve following and overtaking. They helped but created new problems like porposing. The 2026 changes address real issues. Cars too heavy, large, and difficult to follow. The solutions make sense on paper, but teams will optimize active arrow in unimaginable ways, offset weight reduction with performance-enhancing mass, and maximize narrower tires through boundary pushing techniques. This is realism based on decades of F1 history. The regulations Winners, Losers & Unintended Consequences will change the sport, but probably not exactly as intended. For veteran fans who remember simpler, louder, arguably purer F1, these changes represent both progress and compromise. Cars will be more agile with potentially better racing, but also more complex and further from mechanical purity that once defined the sport. For newer fans, 2026 represents witnessing genuine regulatory reset. You'll see team adaptation, driver adjustment, and competitive order reshuffling. The manufacturer entries alone make 2026 worth anticipating. Audi, Ford, and Cadillac bring fresh energy and resources that should elevate competition. Will these regulations Is This Still F1? A Veteran’s Verdict solve F1's problems? Probably not. Not entirely create new ones, almost certainly change the sport meaningfully. Absolutely. The 2026 season won't recreate the golden age older fans remember, nor satisfy everyone's F1 vision, but it represents genuine evolution in a sport struggling to balance tradition with progress. The cars will be smaller, lighter, and more complex. Racing should be closer, and more strategic. The grid features new manufacturers with serious ambitions. It might not be the F1 of the past, but it could be the F1 the future demands. Is 2026 the Revolution F1 needs, or just more of the usual beautiful madness? Like the video.

    "transcript": "Intro Bun has been acquired by Anthropic. Yes, I never thought I'd live to see the day a JavaScript engine being sold to an AI company, but hey, here we are. Now, I think this actually has a lot of implications, and I think one of the biggest implications, which I'm going to like yapagedon about here shortly, has to do with this tweet right here. I believe this new model in Claude Code is a glimpse of the future we're hurdling towards. Maybe as soon as the first half of next year, software engineering is done. Yes, this acquisition of Bun makes a huge statement about this exact tweet from somebody who works on Claude Code. But first, we got to take care of business. Okay, we need to know why did Anthropic buy Bun? Why was Bun looking to be sold? And most importantly, why you should just hit the subscribe button? Because guys, I'm almost to a million. When I cross a million, I never have to ask this question again. So, just press like, press subscribe, get it done with so we could all just move on. You see this black? This is silver. I don't want silver. I want gold. All right. So, first off, why did Bun sell? Why Bun Was Bought Well, it's actually pretty obvious right here. Jared is actually so shockingly open about this. People would frequently ask, \"How is Bun sustainable?\" If I bet my company's tech stack on Bun, will Bun still be around in a few years? We didn't have a great answer to this question until today. This is honestly, this is shockingly honest. This is not something that I think you often see on Twitter. So, hey, I'd really like to say great job Jared for just awesome communication there. Bun practically since its inception has been a VCbacked company. They raised $7 million for their seed round and well, they've been in search of a way to make money and they've never really had a strong answer. Now, Dino, kind of a competitor to that, has always had Dino Deploy and Dino Deploy, of course, they make money. You can see right here, transparent pricing, $20 for pro or custom for enterprise. And so everybody just figured Bun would go down the same road and well they really haven't. And so a lot of people had to ask well you're a VC back to open source project. How are you going to make money? They didn't. They just were bought. And just to kind of make sure everybody understands things that won't change. Bun is going to stay MIT and open source. Bun will continue to be extremely actively maintained. And of course if you ever looked at the creator of Bun's commit graph, it does look very extreme. Which by the way, do you see this little dot right here? On the 28th, there was no contributions on the 28th. Other people asked what was happening right there. And then it turns out the acquisition of Bun 4hour walk probably happened on that day. The same team still works on Bun. Now, this is going to lead to me having a crash out here shortly. Don't worry, we'll we'll get to it. Bun is still public on GitHub and Bun's roadmap will continue to focus on high performance JavaScript tooling, Noode.js compatibility, and replacing Nood.js JS is the default serverside runtime for JavaScript. So, Bun's continuing to claim it's going to operate pretty much as usual. The only big difference they're going to make is this right here. They're going to be hiring more engineers to work on Bun to deliver features faster because well, they got that backing from Anthropic now. But why Why Anthropic Bought Bun would Anthropic want to purchase Bun? Well, I think a very simple answer is this. Bun allows Claude Code to be able to ship self-contained executables that can run on any platform easily. So, I know as much as it pains me to say this, TypeScript is not a bad option to be able to run these tools, except for of course on like say RAM. RAM it just just it just loves it. Just eats all of it. And so, the motivation to me seems at least fairly obvious. Anthropic needs to be able to control the road map of Bun so that they can make sure that the tool they are building will be hopefully the best of all the CLI tools. And that's really because Open Code is an incredible tool. It's growing like absolutely wild right here and it allows you to have any of your models you want. You're not trapped on one. It is by far a very compelling choice and it's also built with bun. So, Anthropic obviously wanted to make sure they have every single edge they can possibly get in developing a good CLI tool. But this is Software Engineering Is Not Dead where the crash out is going to happen. Okay, cuz I did kind of allude to this earlier. Software engineering is done. Now, I don't know what it is. I don't know why it is. It just for some odd reason, this irks me. It's like I I feel just this like great upsetness boiling inside of me every single time I see this. Now, this has been going on since Chad Jippity 35. When Chad Jippy 35 came out, software engineering is done. When 40 came out, software engineering is done. When Claude 35 came out, it was done again. Grock, it was done. Chat, Jippy 5, we're cooked. Everything's over. 5.1, nobody really cared. Claude 37, yeah, no one really liked that one. Claude 4.5, oh yeah, again, it's so over. Gemini 3, it's so over. But you can tell that they don't believe what they say. And here's the simple observation why. What is the license of Bun? Well, Bun itself is MIT licensed. What does that mean? What does what does the president of MIT have to do with software? Well, an MIT license simply means you can do whatever you want with the code. I can fork bun and have Prime Bun. That's it. It can become mine. And there's really nothing that Jared or anyone from the bun team can do. Now, the reality is no one's going to want to use Prime Bun because everybody's working on Bun. Now, let's just give the premise that software engineering is done. Why would Anthropic spend money to buy Bun? Why would Anthropics spend money to aqua hire the entire bun team? I thought software engineering was done. I thought within the next 3 to 6 months, again, by the way, that we were going to have no more software engineering. Why didn't Claude just simply fork Bun and do all the changes itself? Well, I think Claude recognizes very well that they neither have the expertise nor the ability to make Bun significantly better by themselves. And so the best thing they can do is hire the people who run and make bun. They are not giving in to the premise that software engineering is done in six months. In fact, they're doing the exact opposite. They are hiring the experts. They are expanding the team and saying, \"Go as fast as you can and make this product better and better.\" Even though we've been told, \"Hey, this is all over.\" Here they are not living up to the words they say, but instead living up to reality. Because no matter how much you want things to be true, reality always asserts itself in the end. And simply believing you can make software engineers go away because you got a statistical word calculator does not mean it's true. Sure, there's going to be a lot of improvements in our life and software engineering is going to continue to keep changing over the next decade. And I would be a fool to tell you where software engineer is going to be in 10 years, let alone even in 6 months. I have no idea. I'm not out there attempting to be the Oracle of Deli to tell you exactly what your future's going to be. I can tell you one thing. Anthropic believes it's good to have hard skills. You know how I know? Cuz they paid millions of dollars to get those hard skills. Stop listening to the news presses. Stop listening to Daario saying, \"Hey, guess what, boys? It's all over. Everybody's cooked.\" And start looking at where they spend their dollars because that's the real story. That's what they really believe. Of course, Anthropic aren't the only one. Gary, of course, which by the way, YC has some sort of stake in Replet, Emergent Labs, and Tascade is out here saying that you can just over a weekend replace some sort of SAS service, and the SAS service is $30 per seat. I just want you to think about that. We're all software engineers. We've all done this. You're paying a little bit of money to some service, and then you don't like it. So, what do you do? You spend hundreds of hours replacing it, which is a little ridiculous. your time valuing yourself at like $1 per hour. And so when I see these things, it's just like this constant wave of, hey, guess what? It doesn't matter. Everything you build doesn't matter. What he's really saying is every single business he's ever invested in is also rubbish because you over a weekend can simply just vibe code whatever. Oh, you're using Replet. Why would I use Replet? I'm just going to vibe code Replet really quickly. Oh, why would I even use cursor? I'm just going to use cursor to make my own cursor and make a bajillion dollars. Like this premise is just fundamentally dumb. Unless if you have a toddler's understanding of software engineering. Sorry For The Crash Out Okay, I'm sorry for the crash. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I feel strongly about this because I I just I genuinely get so many emails every week with people in an absolute panic because they think software engineering is gone in 3 months and what have I done? I've just spent the last year trying to get good at something and now it's gone. And I feel like the people spreading this stuff, they're actively invested against the words they even say. So yeah, I'm a little bit triggered. But you know what? I think I actually know the real reason why Daario acquired Bun. Okay, this is this is kind of like cutting edge stuff. So you know, you're probably not going to see a lot of this in the news. But if you go over and you look at open codes tool codeex, you'll see right here that 96.9% of it's written in Rust. And if you look at bun, almost 60% of it's written in Zigg. I think these billionaires are playing some language games. Okay, OpenAI clearly cornering the market on Rust. Daario just bought a major position in Zigg. Okay, these billionaires, they're playing games we don't even understand with the languages we love. I even heard that Windsurf is in talks with Phil C. The name is the primogen. The two biggest problems in The Two Biggest Problems Of Computer Science computer science is cash invalidation and pronouncing things. I personally spent all day on teams arguing whether it's SQL or Squeal. Well, I have great news for you today. We have a company that solves both of these problems. Convex. Uh I'm pretty sure that's Convex. Teach out of my ad. Convex lets you ship your backend without a backend team. Its real-time database makes it easy to keep all of your queries up to date. Convex allows you to stop worrying about complicated SQL and untyped messes. Instead, you can embrace Convex's deep TypeScript integration with type completion and validation and database queries that are just pure uncut TypeScript functions.
